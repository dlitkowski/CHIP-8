# CHIP-8   || IN PROGRESS ||
Disassembler and interpreter for the CHIP-8 language, written in C and using the SDL2 library for video, audio, and input. 

The *Disassembler* directory features a program to dump a CHIP-8 binary ROM into assembly language, with descriptions of each command. The *ROMs* directory features binaries to run in the interpreter, and the *Interprer* directory contains the full implementation of the interpreter. 

Many thanks to Wikipedia for information on CHIP-8, and thanks to @kripod for his database of ROMs. Also thanks to @tobiasvl for his font data (I didn't feel like going through the tedium).
